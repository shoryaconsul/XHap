2022-02-03 Yukiteru Ono  <yono@k.u-tokyo.ac.jp>

    Release Version 2.0.2.

    * Added function:
        Error simulation for templates was implemented.

2020-10-30 Yukiteru Ono  <yono@k.u-tokyo.ac.jp>

    Release Version 2.0.1.

    * Added function:
        Prefix of read ID is able to be changed.
        Option --id-prefix was added.

2020-6-20 Yukiteru Ono  <yono@k.u-tokyo.ac.jp>

    Release Version 2.0.0.

    * Added function:
        The function to simulate Nanopore reads was added.
    * Abolished function:
        The function to simulate Circular consensus Read (CCS) was removed.
    * Changed:
        In the model-based simulation, we utilized gamma distribution for read
	length.
    * Changed:
        In the model-based simulation, we utilized exponential distribution for
	read accuracy. The only parameter of this model is a mean of accuracy,
	and minimum and maximum of the accuracy are determined by the mean.
    * Changed:
        In the model-based simulation, quality codes are generated by FIC-HMM
        for each chemistry of PacBio and Nanopore. "--model_qc" option was
	replaced with "--hmm_model" option.
    * Changed:
        Default values of options were fitted to the latest chemistries. 

2013-09-01  Takamasa Imai  <imai@cb.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp>

    Release Version 1.0.3.

    * Added function:
        In order to reproduce the output of PBSIM, "--seed" option was added.
        This option fixes the seed of the pseudorandom number.

2012-10-04  Yukiteru Ono  <ono.yukiteru@imsbio.co.jp>

    Release Version 1.0.2.

    * Added function:
        Samples (specified by --sample-fastq) were able to be reused.
        --sample-profile-id is added and
        --fastq is renamed to --sample-fastq.
    * Changed:
        Multi-FASTA files were able to be acceptable for --sample-fastq.
    * Changed:
        The range of coverage depth (specified by --depth) was changed
        to be from 0 to the maximum integer size, and any float number
        was acceptable. 

2012-06-29  Yukiteru Ono  <ono.yukiteru@imsbio.co.jp>

    Release Version 1.0.1.

    * Changed:
        The output format of read positions in the reference sequence
        was changed to MAF.
    * Fixed bug:
        The swapping between --accuracy-max and --accuracy-min was fixed.
